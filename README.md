## Autonomous Magnetic Resonance Imaging

We introduce AMRI-Scanner as an Online Service (AMRI-SOS). AMRI-SOS is a free to use online service. Fill out this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/1FpGeH7S9SJbaBP53) to request AMRI-SOS scans on a Siemens Prisma 3T. Alternatively, check out the `amri` branch to learn more about AMRI.

AMRI-SOS enables students and researchers with limited access to MRI hardware to leverage AMRI to run custom pulse sequences designed on the Pulseq[[1, 2]](#references) framework.
